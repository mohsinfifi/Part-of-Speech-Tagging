# Part-of-Speech-Tagging

Python code using PyTorch for building a simple bidirectional LSTM-CRF model.

This code provides a basic implementation of a bidirectional LSTM-CRF model for POS tagging in PyTorch. Be sure to replace the sample data and tag-to-index mapping with your own dataset and vocabulary. Additionally, you may need to adapt the code to handle input and output data formats specific to your dataset.
